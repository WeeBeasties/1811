Introduction Methods Data provenance Data provenance refers to a system that permits tracking of the origin, movement, modification, and utilization of data sets (Buneman, Khanna, and Wang-Chiew 2001). The provenance of General Education data will be explicitly declared to facilitate the reproducibility and extensibility of these studies. Location of public website files All files related to this report can be found online at the Open Science Framework (Nosek 2012). This site contains all of the files needed to reproduce this report from the de-identified data set. The site’s url is https://osf.io/t6u8m/. Session information This report was written using RStudio (RStudio Team 2015) and the R statistical programming language (R Core Team 2013). These products are free to download for PC, Macintosh, and Linux operating systems. The following information pertains to the session parameters used to generate this report. If you have trouble reproducing this report, it may be due to different session parameters. You may contact Dr. Franklund if you need assistance.

Anyone wishing to recreate this report from the source document will need to install the following on their computer: An installation of the R programming language An installation of the RStudio IDE An installation of LaTeX The necessary source files include the de-identified data set (BIOL200Data.csv), Rmarkdown code files (index.Rmd, 01-Introduction.Rmd, 02-Methods.Rmd, 03-Results.Rmd, 04-Discussion.Rmd, and 05-References.Rmd), bibtex reference file (references.bib), and custom art file in the /art folder. To process the files, you must first open the project in RStudio. Click on the “Build Book” button in the Build menu. Bookdown allows you to build this project as git_book (html site), pdf_book (via LaTeX), or epub_book (compatible with iBooks and other e-book readers). Citation of this work All of the de-identified data, analysis code, and documentation that constitute this report project may be freely used, modified, and shared.

Retrieving the registration data Data collection All registration records for the fall of 2017 were collated and de-identified. The data file, ‘registrations.csv’, contains only the course name (e.g. BIOL 101), the core competency (e.g. Natural Sciences), and the standardized measure (e.g. Selected Response Exam). The datafile is available here. Results and Discussion A total of 57 registrations have been completed as of September 16, 2018. This represents the efforts of 32 faculty, and includes a total of 42 different courses. These numbers are down from last semester as shown by Figure 1. Figure 1: Comparison of registrations between Fall 2017 and Spring 2018. As compared to Fall 2017, the total number of registrations was down by 79.7%. Moreover, the number of faculty members registering to report assessment was strongly down (by 74%). This primarily reflects the fact the the Ferris Non-Tenured Faculty Organization members have elected to not participate in assessment. Since those members registered but did not report data last semester, the actual amound of data that we collect this semester may still be similar to that of last semester. Finally, the number of courses reporting is also down this semester (by 69.6%). This may reflect an actual difference in the number of General Education courses offered each semester. Or… it may just reflect a decreasing rate of partipation in this process. Are you concerned by the decrease in registrations this semester? What factors do you think are contributing to this trend? What suggestions do you have to address the decrease in registrations? The distribution of the registrations between the eight core competencies for the spring semester is shown in Figure 2. Figure 2: Distribution of course registrations by core competency. A total of 24 exams were registered (%). A total of 27 student products were registered (%). A total of 6 student performances were registered (%). Figure 3: Distribution of course registrations by standardized measure. Do you think that there are too many exams in this mix? What is the desired balance between exams, products, and performances for General Education? References "]
